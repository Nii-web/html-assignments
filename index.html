    <p>
      Situated in south-east Siberia, the 3.15-million-ha Lake Baikal is the
      oldest (25 million years) and deepest (1,700 m) lake in the world. It
      contains 20% of the world's total unfrozen freshwater reserve. Known as
      the 'Galapagos of Russia', its age and isolation have produced one of the
      world's richest and most unusual freshwater faunas, which is of
      exceptional value to evolutionary science.

    <pre>
        The Committee inscribed Lake Baikal as the most outstanding example of a freshwater ecosystem on the basis of natrual criteria (vii), (viii), (ix) and (x). 

        It is the oldest and deepest of the world´s lakes containing nearly 20% of the world´s unfrozen freshwater reserve. 

        The lake contains an outstanding variety of endemic flora and fauna, which is of exceptional value to evolutionary science.

        It is also surrounded by a system of protected areas that have high scenic and other natural values.
        
        The Committee took note of the confirmation of the revised boundaries of the site, which correspond to the core areas defined in the Baikal Law (excluding the five urban developed areas).

         It also noted that the special Lake Baikal Law is now in its second reading in the Duma. 

         Finally, it noted concern over a number of integrity issues including pollution, which should be brought to the attention of the Russian authorities.

      The Lake Baikal Coastal Protection Zone, covering the lake and its
      environs (a total of 34,000 square miles [88,000 square km]), was created
      in 1987, and the same area was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in
      1996.
